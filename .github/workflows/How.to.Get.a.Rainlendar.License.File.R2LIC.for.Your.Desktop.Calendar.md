# How to Get a Rainlendar License File (R2LIC) for Your Desktop Calendar
 
Rainlendar is a customizable desktop calendar application that works on Windows, Mac and Linux. It allows you to keep track of your events and tasks, set alarms, print calendars, and more. Rainlendar Lite is free to download and use, but if you want to enjoy some extra features, such as network shared calendars, Outlook support, Google Calendar synchronization, and backup and restore, you need to purchase a Rainlendar Pro license for 9.95 EUR[^1^].

A Rainlendar Pro license is a file with the .r2lic extension that contains your personal information and activation code. You need to place this file in your Rainlendar settings folder, which is usually located at C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\.rainlendar2 on Windows, /Users/YourUserName/Library/Preferences/Rainlendar2 on Mac, or /home/YourUserName/.rainlendar2 on Linux[^2^]. If you don't have this file, Rainlendar will not recognize your license and will run in Lite mode.
 
So how do you get a Rainlendar license file (r2lic)? Here are the steps:
 
1. Go to [Rainlendar's website](https://www.rainlendar.net/) and download the latest version of Rainlendar Pro for your operating system.
2. Install Rainlendar Pro on your computer and run it.
3. Go to [Rainlendar's purchase page](https://www.rainlendar.net/purchase) and click on the "Purchase" button. You will be redirected to PayPal where you can pay with your credit card or PayPal account.
4. After completing the payment, you will receive an email from Rainlendar with your license file attached. Save the file to your computer.
5. Copy the license file (r2lic) to your Rainlendar settings folder. You may need to restart Rainlendar for the changes to take effect.
6. Enjoy your Rainlendar Pro features!

If you have any problems with your license file, you can contact Rainlendar's support forum[^2^] or email them at support@rainlendar.net.

## How to Customize Rainlendar Skins
 
One of the best features of Rainlendar is that you can change its appearance with skins. Skins are files that contain the graphics and layout information for the calendar windows. Rainlendar comes with several built-in skins, such as Shadow4, Chromophore, and Lucid, but you can also download and install more skins from [Rainlendar's skin gallery](https://www.rainlendar.net/cms/index.php?option=com_rny_skins&Itemid=30) or create your own skins with [Rainlendar Skin Builder](https://www.rainlendar.net/cms/index.php?option=com_rny_skinbuilder&Itemid=31).
 
To change the skin of Rainlendar, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on any Rainlendar window and select "Options" from the menu.
2. In the Options dialog, go to the "Skins" tab and select the skin you want to use from the list. You can also click on the "Install" button to browse for a skin file (.r2skin) on your computer or drag and drop a skin file to the list.
3. Click on the "Apply" button to see the changes. You can also click on the "Preview" button to see how the skin looks before applying it.
4. If you want to customize the skin further, you can click on the "Advanced >>" button to access more options, such as window position, size, transparency, color, font, etc. You can also edit the skin files directly with a text editor or Rainlendar Skin Builder if you know how to use XML and Lua scripting.

That's how you can customize Rainlendar skins. Have fun experimenting with different looks for your desktop calendar!
